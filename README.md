# Task-Specific-Embeddings-NLP
This repository explores the comparison between general embeddings (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and task-specific embeddings in NLP. It demonstrates how task-specific pre-training can improve performance on tasks like classification, NER, and QA. Includes code, methodology, and experimental results for enhancing NLP models.
